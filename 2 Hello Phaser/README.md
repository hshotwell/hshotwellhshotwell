## Second Exercise PHASER JS! 

Lets get that engine in and running! Go to http://phaser.io/ and download the engine!
Load the engine into the index.html file! (I'm gonna be vauge on purpose here.)

Load the js files "basic.js" in "index.html" It's the script for the example. 

phaser has a bit of trouble with it's asset loader if it's not hosted on a server. 
Nows a good time to install python and use it to host the files locally. 
https://www.python.org/

once you got python you can go into a terminal and navigate to your project file for this example and use this command: 
``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 ```


Push the changes to your forked repo and let me know so we can chat about it.
